# Instructor-Student Communications

## READ FIRST: What this is and isn't.

This is intended to be a library of past experiences \(anonymized for privacy\) of how certain challenging interactions with students where handled and resolved.

### Is

* A Reference for new instructors and mentors to see how to handle potentially tough situations 
* A Field guide of old stories to help provide new insights and ideas on working with students.

### Isn't

* A copy and paste guide, Each student is unique in their problems, use these to help fuel healthy responses using knowledge of the others
* The Source of Truth. All of these examples are presented as informal case studies and information to help guide and frame conversions with students that might not cut and dry or slightly outside of the instructors comfort zone.  

## Scenario: A student that has been falling behind on work and struggling to grasp concepts, wants to take a day off to prevent burn out.  

Context: This student, named Kirsten, has been falling behind in work. They seem stressed out not only due to the course, but also due to external pressures. They have slacked their instructor saying they will not be in today with this message:

`Kirsten: Good Morning! Today I am going to take this day to rest and visit with family. I will be checking for the homework. I don't want to get that burnt out feeling so I think this would be the best time to do this.`

The instructor should be supportive in the efforts of the students to take care of themselves, but also to make sure that they students know that being here is part of the value of the education we provide. Sample instructor response.

`Instructor: Good Morning Kirsten. If you need time to get better and take care of things, then take, but remember, everyday you are not here, you are missing out on content, exposure and learning. Keep an eye our for notes, communicate with your peers on any group projects and let me know if you have any questions or issues.`

Desired outcome: A students mental health is important to keep in a healthy state. But when a student is having a hard time, it's super important to try to keep the student on campus. This will not only help the student learn by being apart of the class activities, but it will the student be around there peers and instructors and build a support system around them. With them being on campus it opens up time to get work done, ask questions and give the students and outlet to find help, for both personal and professional topics.
