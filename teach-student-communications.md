# Instructor Student Communications

## What to say when student is missing a day for "personal reasons" and is falling behind in their work.

Context: This student, named  Kirsten, has been falling behind in work. They seem stressed out not only due to the couse, but also due to external pressures. They have slacked their instructor saying they will not be in today with this message: 

`Kirsten: Good Morning! Today I am going to take this day to rest and visit with family. I will be checking for the homework. I don't want to get that burnt out feeling so I think this would be the best time to do this.`

The instructor should be supportive in the efforts of the students to take care of themselves, but also to make sure that they students know that being here is part of the value of the education we provide. Sample instructor response.

`Instructor: Good Morning Kirsten. If you need time to get better and take care of things, then take, but remember, everyday you are not here, you are missing out on content, exposure and learning. Keep an eye our for notes, communicate with your peers on any group projects and let me know if you have any questions or issues.`

 

## Have you had a chance to answer the previous question?s

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.
