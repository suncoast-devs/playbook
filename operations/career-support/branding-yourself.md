When conducting a job search or even just maintaining your visibility to potential employers it is important to brand yourself.

Branding yourself can be done in many ways and it works best when customized to fit each person's personality, life experiences, and work experiences.

So how do you "brand yourself"?

## Branding as a Beginner Developer

Choose one thing that you would like to integrate from your past profession or personal experience

- Do you have great soft skills from customer service experience?
- Do you have a background in Project Management?
- Do you have an eye for design?
- What skills/experience have you acquired that you can use to help you continue to grow
- How can you use such skills/experience to benefit employers?

Where do you see yourself in two years post SDG?

- Think long-term, what areas can you continue to grow to help you reach your goals?

## LinkedIn

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/): Manage your professional identity. Build and engage with your professional network. Access knowledge, insights and opportunities.

- Headline
  - The headline should state what you do, it can be an actual job title you have or more general if preferred.
  - General Examples:
    - Web Developer
    - Software Engineer
- Description
  - Create a headline that describes your experience, skills or tells employers about you.
  - Check your profile when you are done, make sure the most important info comes before the user has to click "Show More"
- Experience
  - List your current and previous employers
  - It is ok to limit older employers, you don't need to show every job you have ever had
  - SDG can be listed here as experience if you prefer
- Education
  - List SDG and other education experiences
- Volunteer Experience
  - Did you volunteer for SDG Kids classes or maybe another organization? List your volunteer experiences, this shows employers you are community minded.
- Skills & Endorsements
  - Start listing your skills. During the course, you learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc.
  - Endorse each other, you know what you have learned and work side by side so endorse others when you feel comfortable.
  - SDG staff can endorse you once you complete the program
- Recommendations
  - Ask for recommendations from co-workers, previous employers, each other.
  - If you don't feel comfortable asking someone for a recommendation, try recommending them first and then reach out to see if they would do the same.
  - Recommend each other, this is a great way to support each other and help highlight strengths someone may not see in themselves.
- Accomplishments
  - Have you received an award or finished an online course that gave you a certificate? List them here.
  - Have you worked on a group project? You can add project details and link them to who you worked with to complete it.
- Interests
  - Do you love MLB, Designing, etc? Want to follow a company that you want to more about? This is the place to get updates on areas/companies you are interested in.
- Bonus - domain
  - LinkedIn lets you update the link that others use to find your account. You no longer need to have a link that looks like "linkedin.com/in/samantha-jones-08923b367" you can have a link that is closer to "linkedin.com/in/samantha-jones" or "linkedin.com/in/samjones"

## Social Media Platforms

- [GitHub](https://github.com/): GitHub brings together the world's largest community of developers to discover, share, and build better software.
- [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/): Find Meetups so you can do more of what matters to you. Or create your own group and meet people near you who share your interests.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com): From breaking news and entertainment to sports and politics, get the full story with all the live commentary.
- ALL
  - Photo
    - Have a nice headshot taken and use it across all accounts you use professionally. This helps others recognize you online or in person.
  - Consistent name, handle, and headline if possible
    - If you go by a shortened name and want to be called by that be sure to use it everywhere. People will address you by what they are familiar with.

## Twitter

- \# - Use hashtags to tag your content and reach out to people that may not follow you directly
- @ - Reach out to someone directly by putting the @ symbol in front of their handle/name
- Retweet and share what you find through others, this is a great way to be active online without coming up with original content.
