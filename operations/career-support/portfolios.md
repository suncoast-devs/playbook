title: Your Portfolio, Your North Star
draft: true
---

Your brand and the visual representation of your work.

## First Impression

Employers look through 5 to 30+ portfolios when hiring

- Within 5 seconds they can see the type of visual craftsmanship
- This means:
- A clear hierarchy of information
- Site needs to be simple and aesthetically pleasing
- The typography needs to be appropriate & readable
- Not a designer? That’s ok!
- Find a template
- Own the template
- Better to use a template than attempt to be a designer and fail

## Content of your Work

- 3 - 5 projects
- Should be your best work and the best parts of your work
- Present it like a project/work not an assignment
- If it doesn’t exist in the real world you can say it was a “concept”
- Try and have at least one freelance or real world project
- Your work should be a mix of what you have done and what you want to do æ
- Don’t present anything you aren’t proud of
- Own it or don’t show it
- A quick scan will allow the reader to get a sense of your ability

## Display of your Work

- Show details and big picture
- Showcase your ability to craft both
- Can the reader understand the context of your work?
- Mobile work? Show it on a device
- Teamwork? Show what you built and own it
- Proud of the code? Show it
- Concept
- It’s better to be good than original
- Clever is great but can be really hard to pull off

## Your Story

- Be able to tell it BOTH in your work and about yourself
- Your work tells a story of your journey
- About/bio section
- Tell a bit about yourself but keep it brief enough to scan
- Have a professional/appropriate/character exhibiting photo of yourself
