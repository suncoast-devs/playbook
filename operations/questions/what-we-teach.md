Thank you for reaching out to us and asking about our program at Suncoast Developers Guild. At this time we are only offering our web development course, you can find more information about our current course at https://suncoast.io/academy.

Our President, Toni Warren, discussed why we teach what we do in a recent interview that you might find interesting. As part of the interview, Toni says a few things that help answer why we don't focus on R, machine learning, python, AI, etc:

"We get a lot of questions about why we teach what we teach, and there are a few reasons. One is, we are going to teach the programming skills that will allow students to become successful as developers in their long-term career, but we also teach them web development skills that are needed in Tampa Bay. "

"We teach our students, first and foremost, how to be programmers. We teach them how to think like engineers."

"Due to our provisional license from the State, we can’t add or change any of our curriculum for another year. What we can do, and what we’d like to do one day, is add a DevOps and UI/UX program. Right now, our focus is just building the web development program and possibly offering some intro courses or weekend / evening courses for people who are considering joining the full-time program."

Thank you again for reaching out and please let us know if there are any other questions that we might be able to answer for you about our program.
