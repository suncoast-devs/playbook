## Tuition & Financing

Tuition is a flat fee of $14,900 for the entire three-month program. The tuition does not include any costs associated with parking, meals, or any other fees not specifically provided for in this catalog or the enrollment agreement. The tuition does not include any costs that may be required for, or associated with, the purchase of a laptop computer.

Payment
After being accepted in to the program, you can reserve a seat in our course with a deposit of $1,000. The entire amount of the deposit will be applied to your tuition balance, and the remaining funds will be due before the first day of class. Payment can be made by check, money order, debit, or credit card.

### Loanable

Loanable helps students get the financing they need for coding bootcamps (tuition, equipment costs, and/or living expenses) through low-interest friends and family loans. Students are also able to split their total financing need into small chunks (think $500) allowing several of their friends and family to contribute as a group. You can also decide to get a friends and family loan for a specific expense like a computer or the first month of living expenses. If the student is not able to get all the funding they need from friends and family, we have great lending partners that provide the additional capital that they need.
