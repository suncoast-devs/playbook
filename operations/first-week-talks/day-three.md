“Try not to waste time worrying about what you don't know — there's really not enough energy for that. It will all make sense in time.”

## Reframing Failure

The “best” software developers maintain a growth mindset vs. a fixed one.

- Learn from trial and error
- Embrace failure as part of the process
- Don’t give up
- Emphasis on the journey, not the destination
- Fail quickly, gather information, and iterate
- Use ‘failure” as an opp to add new knowledge to your toolbox
- Confusion is a sign that you are about to learn something.
